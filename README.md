## Preliminary analysis
As an important part of our analysis, we were curious about how the various numerical variables relate to each other. Hence, we plot a Correlation plot. Here is the plot :



The main take-aways from the above plot are these :

• The response variable *Price* is positively correlated with the variable *Cylinders*.

• It is negatively correlated with the variable *Odometer*.

• Year has a very slight correlation with *Price*.

We now start off with looking at how our response variable **Price** is spread.
